2/20/24 4:21PM - The first issue I encountered was getting this repository set up.  The repository wasn't trusted at first, and then it wasn't connected to the remote at github. After 15 minutes of troubleshooting, I was finally able to get it working.

2/20/24 10:04PM - The next issue is that I am getting a 503 Service Unavailable response from time to time; however, when it does work, I get a correct response. 

10:33PM - Another issue I am encountering is that the request takes "too long" (or more my code goes too quickly) and I skip over the code I need that would parse the response, solution soon?

11:11PM - Still not able to let the GET request happen and let it do its thing before it decides to give up.

1am - im tired and its still not working
